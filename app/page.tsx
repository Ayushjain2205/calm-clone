                    Mindfulness is a practice that involves intentionally bringing one's attention and awareness to the
                    present moment without judgment. It's about being fully present and engaged in the here and now,
                    rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. Mindfulness encourages a
                    non-judgmental attitude towards one's thoughts, emotions and sensations, allowing them to arise and
                    pass without any added stress. By cultivating mindfulness, people often develop a greater sense of
                    clarity, calmness and overall wellbeing, as well as enhance their ability to respond skillfully to
                    the challenges of life.

                    Although it's commonly known now that there are different 'colors' of noises, it might not be known
                    what the difference between them are. Different types of noise have distinct frequency
                    characteristics, which means that the energy of the sound is distributed differently across the
                    frequency spectrum. As a result, how you perceive each noise can affect the use-case of each
                    frequency.

                  <p className="text-[rgba(0,0,0,0.8)]">
                    White noise has equal power in every frequency band, between 20 hertz and 20,000 hertz, and gives
                    your brain something relaxing to focus on; this can help block out distractions and make it perfect
                    for sleep. Similarly, brown noise has more energy at lower frequencies, giving it a deep, 'booming'
                    noise. It is commonly used for relaxation and sleep.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-[rgba(0,0,0,0.8)]">
                    Pink noise has less energy at higher frequencies. Pink noise is often described as having a "fuller"
                    sound compared to white noise. Naturally occurring examples of pink noise are rustling leaves, wind,
                    and heartbeats.

                    Lastly, it is theorized that green noise is calming because it simulates the spectrum of natural
                    noise without human-made noises; this noise has more energy at mid-range frequencies and is
                    sometimes used in sound masking for tinnitus.

                    brain hears two slightly different frequencies, it tries to "reconcile" them by producing a third
                    frequency that is the difference between the two. This is known as the "frequency following
                    response," and it is believed to influence brain waves in a way that can be beneficial for focus and
                    relaxation.

                    Some research suggests that listening to binaural beats can help improve focus and reduce anxiety by
                    promoting a state of relaxation and reducing stress levels. One theory is that binaural beats can
                    influence the production of alpha waves in the brain, which are associated with relaxation and
                    reduced anxiety.

                    Another theory is that binaural beats can help entrain the brain to a specific frequency associated
                    with improved focus or creativity. For example, some studies have suggested that listening to
                    binaural beats in the alpha or theta frequency range can help improve cognitive performance and
                    enhance creativity.

                    However, while some research has shown potential benefits of binaural beats for certain conditions,
                    such as anxiety and depression, the evidence is not yet conclusive.
